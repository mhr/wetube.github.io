    	<h1>FAQ</h1>
      
    	<div id="q1" class="box">
      		<a href="#q1">
        		If you could explain Bitcloud in one sentence, what would it be?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		Bitcloud is an open source software platform for cryptographically supported, distributed grid-based, network services (i.e., beginning with storage) that are automatically managed and maintained by randomly assigned consensus synchronization operations.  (Phew.  You asked for it.)
        	</div>
    	</div>
        <div id="q2" class="box">
      		<a href="#q2">
        		What is the approach you're taking on building this platform?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		The Bitcloud project is a heirarchy-free, consensus driven project.  The worker-contributors are the owners of the project and its development of the Bitcloud platform.
        	</div>
    	</div>
        <div id="q3" class="box">
      		<a href="#q3">
        		What is your viewpoint on similar projects like this such as Maidsafe and Tahoe-LAFS?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		Bitcloud has learned from a variety of previously developed projects (including LAFS, etc.), with lessons reflected upon current Bitcloud design.
        		However, no known project currently has the design and/or strategy that Bitcloud seeks to implement.  Still, the Bitcloud team always looks to cooperate with compatible projects versus compete.
        	</div>
    	</div>
        <div id="q4" class="box">
      		<a href="#q4">
        		What is the timeline for this project? What is your plan to go about building this?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		<BR>The timeline is currently under development.  However, current-state timeline appears to indicate the likelihood of design completion before 05/2014, 
        		Alpha version completion on or before 7/2014, and Beta version completion on or before 9/2014.</BR>
        		<BR>The fundraising campaign will begin along with the start of coding work, and will be managed in paralell using a phased approach.</BR>
        		<BR>As an open source project, developer resources are donated but also not reliably available on a full-time basis, so timelines are subject to change.</BR>

        <div id="q5" class="box">
      		<a href="#q5">
        		Where can I find more information about this?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		<BR>We offer a great deal of information for our project, and documentation is continuing to be developed. Of course, this website is a great initial information resource,
        		since it contains the overview of what the Bitcloud team plans to accomplish. A blog and a forum will also run of this 
        		website which will provide current project information.</BR>
        		
        		<BR>Apart from the above, we offer a technical wiki - see link at the top of this 
        		page - for those with greater technical undestanding of the programming world. Bitcloud project has a
        		github page, which also hosts one location of our white paper (both technical and non-technical).</BR>
        		
        		<BR>The team also uses and communicates on a freenode IRC channel where we discuss the project. You are welcome to ask 
        		questions within this channel, along with Facebook, twitter, and other social networking pages.</BR>

        <div id="q6" class="box">
      		<a href="#q6">
        		Why did you choose to go this route, with bitcoin-like protocols that aim to decentralize the internet?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		<BR>The very reason that bitcoin chose to decentralize the recording of transactions. The problem with 
        		centralisation is that it gives to much power to those who hold the data. In the case of bitcoin,
        		they wish to grant the use of currency back to their user - where governments can not increase
        		the currency in circulation leading to inflation.</BR>
        		
        		<BR>Now, with our project, we wish to do the same thing with the internet - we wish to grant internet
        		users back their power. By removing the ISP, we remove the problems of filtering, bandwidth 
        		throttling etc., and to keep anonyimity (we plan to link into the TOR system). By distributing 
        		the system, we ensure that no one can have complete power over the system - each node needs another
        		node, and so can not exist soley and thus have little power over the user.</BR>

      		<a href="#q7">
        		How can I help contribute?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		<BR>There are many ways to help out! As this is a programming project, of course we need programmers,
        		so if you have any experience in programming, than you are more than welcome to join us, for almost
        		any language (we are aiming for cross platform, even to mobile devices).</BR>
        		
        		<BR>We also need people in other disciplines - we keep up social media sites which need to be updated.
        		We also need a more general PR team, to handle user responses.</BR>
        		
        		<BR>For those with a more artistic touch, we are also creating videos for this project, and need icon
        		and graphic creation, music creation etc.</BR>
        		
        		<BR>So, feel free to join :).</BR>

        		Who should I go to if I want to get started?
        	</a>
      		<div class="answer">
        		<!-- ANSWER -->
        		As mentioned above in the "find out more question", there are multiple avenues of contact. For more
        		specific contacts, we are operating our own email address. On top of this, we do operate two IRC 
        		channels - #bitcloud and #bitcloud-dev - on the freenode network, where you can answer a question
        		and it will be answered quite quickly by whicher team member is online.
